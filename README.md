# Enhancing Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) Tumor Segmentation through Aortic Contrast-Enhanced Imaging with UNETR

## Abstract
I conducted a research project focused on enhancing the diagnostic precision of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) using the UNETR model. The primary objective was to improve the contrast enhancement of HCC tumors for better segmentation and detection. A significant part of this project involved adjusting the HCC contrast through the aorta contrast, which proved to be a crucial factor in achieving more accurate tumor segmentation.

The key strategy of this project involved using the contrast levels derived from aortic imaging to adjust the contrast of HCC tumors. This approach focused on enhancing the clarity of HCC contrast by leveraging the distinct imaging characteristics of the aorta. By referencing the unique contrast levels obtained from aortic images, the UNETR model was able to more effectively amplify the contrast between HCC tumors and surrounding tissues. This adjustment enabled more precise segmentation and identification of tumors, significantly improving the precision of HCC diagnosis. Utilizing the contrast information from aortic imaging in this manner is expected to contribute to more accurate detection and treatment planning for HCC.
