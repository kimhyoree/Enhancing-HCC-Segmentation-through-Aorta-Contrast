# Improving HCC diagnostic precision in CT using UNETR model

## Abstract
The aim of this research project was to improve the diagnostic precision of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) by utilizing the UNETR model in CT imaging. The primary objective was the enhancement of contrast in HCC tumors, thereby enabling more accurate detection across the entire image. This was achieved through a comprehensive adjustment of the contrast using the following formula: 
[Corrected Contrast=Original Contrast√ó(Aorta Contrast/Original Contrast)]
This method employed the aorta's contrast as a calibrating factor, uniformly amplifying the HCC contrast in the imaging data. By applying this ratio, we were able to consistently enhance the visibility and differentiation of the HCC tumors.
